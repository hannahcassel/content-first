        <h1>A Dao of Web Design: A Summary</h1>

    	<p class="summarytext">The author senses a disconnect between “the web as we know it, and the web as it would be.” Printed page has been the longstanding norm, and when the web was created, it was adapted to make users most comfortable. What we were most comfortable with at the time was print. <strong>Therefore, thoughtless habits were formed.</strong></p>
       	<p class="summarytext">Another detrimental idea is the “designer is controller” philosophy, which is formed from the fact that in print, the designer is in fact governing over every part of the design. But the emerging role of web designers is to surrender that control, and resign to the fact that the user’s viewing experience cannot be guarded.</p>
        <p class="summarytext">This resignation of control should be seen as a strength of a new medium, not a limitation. Designers should adapt to this new belief that web does not have to have constraints, and embrace its flexibility by accepting “the ebb and flow of things.”</p>
        <p class="summarytext">Accessibility is important in this new philosophy. Adaptable pages are accessible pages, and this is a great achievement to look forward to in the future of the web. Once we fully embrace the web’s flexibility, we will be able to achieve a universal, accessible web for all.</p>
